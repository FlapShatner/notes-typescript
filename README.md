This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Notes App

This is a super basic TypeScript project I'm building for fun and practice.

Create new notes on the "Create" page and view them on the Main page.
Tags can be added to the notes to use as filters, or there's a search function to find specific notes by title.

Data is all stored on a postgresql database so it can be persisted indefinitely.

I plan to get NextAuth hooked up to make it possible to sign in and view your personal notes.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install node modules

```bash
npm install
```

Then run it in the terminal

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Now open a web page to http://localhost:3000 to start it up.
